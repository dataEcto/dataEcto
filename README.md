## Why hello there!

My name is Genric Elazegui. This is my GitHub page with various mini-personal projects/college assignments. I enjoy programming gameplay mechanics and putting new twists on them to enhance the player experience, such as repurposing a health bar to work as a progress bar. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: A Top Down Stealth Game created with the help of Top Down Engine, injecting my own code to make it more of my own work.
